# How to contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project.  There are
a just a few small guidelines you need to follow.


## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to any Google project must be accompanied by a Contributor
License Agreement.  This is not a copyright **assignment**, it simply gives
Google the necessary legal rights to use your contribution.

  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you
    own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual
    CLA](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual).

  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
    then you'll need to sign a [corporate
    CLA](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate).

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted
one (even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.
