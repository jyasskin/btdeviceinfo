Bluetooth Device Information
============================

Chrome App for interacting with BTLE devices that expose the Device Info service.

This is a [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/) app, so you'll need to do a couple steps before loading it into Chrome:

1. Run `bower install` to create the `bower_components` directory.
2. Open the project in [the Chrome Dev Editor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-dev-editor-develop/pnoffddplpippgcfjdhbmhkofpnaalpg).
3. Right click on `bower_components`, and select `Refactor for CSP`.

Then you should be able to iterate as normal.
